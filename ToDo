Roadmap:
- fixing backspace on keyboard input
- adding a virtual keyboard
- third device layer
- Changing the button on PC.
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network
- GUI
- File management
	- for basic stuff SDL, but also
	- searching files
	- creating folder

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
