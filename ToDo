Roadmap:
- some objects have very strange project fails with too high accuracy
- RectangleBorder and EllipseBorder faster and more accurate
- Network
- Mouse
- fixing system surface stuff
- sprite format
- button signs in the font engine

version: 1.01

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
