Roadmap til next version (tag):
- File management
	- Searching files
	  - Windows
- perspective texture mapping

general Roadmap:
- third device layer (controlled by sparrowCore)
  - axis are exactly the same
  - as much buttons createable as you want
  - button relation changeable
  - button name from host spGetButtonName
  - button is identifyable by name and id.
    - int spNewButton(char* name) => returns id (faster)
    - spGetButtonByName, spGetButtonByID
    - Returns *int => changeable
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network (with threads)
- GUI

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
