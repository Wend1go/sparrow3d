Roadmap til next version (1.3.1):
- drawing primitives as parallel process
	- gp2x:
		- zBuffer needs to be in upper mem!
		- division buffer in upper mem!
		- zfar in upper mem!
		- all math functions to upper mem!
		- init gp2x coprocessor
		- mutex for the state of the process
		- spBindTexture
			- setting getting physical address for gp2x for stack

Roadmap til 1.4:
- all 12 tutorials (4/12 done)
- Network (with threads)
- GUI

general Roadmap:
- rotozoom on second processor
- all blits on second processor
- third device layer (controlled by sparrowCore)
  - axis are exactly the same
  - as much buttons createable as you want
  - button relation changeable
  - button name from host spGetButtonName
  - button is identifyable by name and id.
    - int spNewButton(char* name) => returns id (faster)
    - spGetButtonByName, spGetButtonByID
    - Returns *int => changeable
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- sparrowText faster Lookup: O(log(n)) instead of O(n)

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
