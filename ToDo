Roadmap:
+ copy & paste the matrix stuff from engine.c
+ implementation of 3D quads and triangles
+ Searching all places, where I divide and try to use one_over_x-function,
  especally at normale calculation. rotation doesn't matter, to seldom...
+ cube example with garfield :)
+ asm optimization for hline like stuff
+ "real" quads
+ much assembler code review to optimize the puzzle tube like example. 29 fps peak now (23 fps peak before)
+ blitting a surface with(out) projection and with(out) ztest
+ Pink = Alpha
  + e.g. spSetAlpha(value) like the z-stuff
  + implementation in
    + polygon
    + blit
- font loading
  - setting, which characters the user wants (with saving in binary tree)
    - multiple fonts (e.g. differnt font, differnt size, etc.) possible
    - every fonts has its own root.
  - loading theses characters in 16 Bit - pink is alpha surfaces
  - feedbackfunction, which recreates all these characters
  - getSurface(character,root)
  - Drawing function with(out) zoom and with(out) z-stuff
  - 3D function for the both possibilities (fontBlit and fontRender)
- Porting Puzzletube to sparrow3D
  - Using 1 Quads or 2 Triangles with texture instead of the modells
  - Using "dizzy" Alpha (monochrome-Alpha) for selection
- reimplementation of light
  - spSetLight(value) in spRender like z-stuff
  - global Light as one function
  - up to 8 lights (openGL like)
    - using in the spRender in all Render-functions
  - one white default light at (0,0,0)
- defining of a type for loading obj
- drawing a couple of points and polygons (meshs) at once
- loading obj
- giving the possiblity to load Imges directly with the screen surface 16 Bit
  and with the possibilty to search every (255,0,255) and to change it a lil
  bit, so that it looks like the transparent color, but doesn't make the object
  transparent, e.g. if you have a rainbow dash texture and don't want the pink
  part of the tail transparent...
- try to compile for every system and getting fps from testers

Nice to have:
- better Quads 
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
