Roadmap:
+ copy & paste the matrix stuff from engine.c
+ implementation of 3D quads and triangles
- Searching all places, where I divide and try to use one_over_x-function,
  especally at normale calculation. rotation doesn't matter, to seldom...
- cube example with garfield :)
- try to compile for every system and getting fps from testers
- reimplementation of light (light sources + one globlale diffuse light)
- fake implementation (definitions and empty implementations) for
  - blitting a surface with(out) projection and with(out) ztest
  - two types of font. First with normal blitting like the font in engine.c,
    second one uses the same surface, but uses the triangle function to zoom
- Porting Puzzletube to sparrow3D. Using 1 Quads or 2 Triangles with texture
  instead of the modells
- defining of a type for loading obj
- drawing a couple of points and polygons (meshs) at once
- loading obj
- implementing a transparent color (255,0,255)
- giving the possiblity to load Imges directly with the screen surface 16 Bit
  and with the possibilty to search every (255,0,255) and to change it a lil
  bit, so that it looks like the transparent color, but doesn't make the object
  transparent, e.g. if you have a rainbow dash texture and don't want the pink
  part of the tail transparent...

Nice to have:
- better Quads 
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
