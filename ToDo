README:
- -1 near stuff
Roadmap:
- utf8 support in sparrow3d
- marking, which signs we need in the language file
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
