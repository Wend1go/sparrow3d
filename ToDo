Roadmap:
- reimplementation of light
  - spSetLight(value) in spRender like z-stuff
  - global Light as one function
  - up to 8 lights (openGL like)
    - using in the spRender in all Render-functions
  - one white default light at (0,0,0)
- Edgelist
- Sound API. Bitches LOVE Sound.
- Sprites


Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
