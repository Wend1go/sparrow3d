Roadmap til next version (tag):
- Graphics:
	- Possibility to define a 8x8 pattern with a 64 bit or two 32 bit
	  numbers. Not set bits will NOT be drawn. Useful for lineskip stuff
	  or alpha simulation
	- a function, which returns one pattern for every alpha value from
	  0 to 255.
	- Implementing the pattern stuff. XD
	  + flat 
	  + texture
	  + texture alpha
	  - line
	  - rectangles
	  - ellipses
	  - blit
- Input:
	- adding a virtual keyboard
	- third device layer
	- Changing the buttons on PC.


general Roadmap:
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network
- GUI
- File management
	- for basic stuff SDL, but also
	- searching files
	- creating folder

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
