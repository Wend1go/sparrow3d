Roadmap til next version (tag):
- Input:
	- adding a virtual keyboard
		+ showing
		+ input with hardware buttons / axis
		+ input with touchscreen
		- Two keyboards with the two shift states

general Roadmap:
- third device layer
- Changing the buttons on PC.
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network
- GUI
- File management
	- for basic stuff SDL, but also
	- searching files
	- creating folder

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
