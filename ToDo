Roadmap til next version (tag):
- Graphics:
	- a function, which returns a pattern for every alpha value from 0 to 255.
- Input:
	- adding a virtual keyboard
	- third device layer
	- Changing the buttons on PC.


general Roadmap:
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network
- GUI
- File management
	- for basic stuff SDL, but also
	- searching files
	- creating folder

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
