README:
- -1 near stuff
- Difference spScreen, spWindow, spRenderTarget
Roadmap:
- emulated Mousesuport for devices without touchscreen
- spFont additionals:
	- support for managing different texts in different languages
		- spFontText* text = spFontCreateText()
		- spFontAddTranslation(text,language,translation)
			- text is a created text
			- language is an int, where only the first 16 bit are used
			- translation is a const char* with the translation of the text.
		- spFontText* spFontCreateTextWithAdd(language,tranlation)
		  - creates a text with a first translation
		- spFontSetLanguage(language)
		  - sets the language of the program. This language will be searched in every
		    text. If the language is not found, the FIRST added language will be
		    used, so it makes sense to create English first.
- Network
- fixing system surface stuff
- sprite format
- button signs in the font engine

Nice to have:
