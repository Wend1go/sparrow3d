Roadmap til 1.4:
- sparrowNet new example
	- server and client in one
	- new server registers with broadcast!
- all 12 tutorials (4/12 done)
- Skeleton project

Roadmap til 1.5:
- GUI
	- relative GUI in a 1.0f x 1.0f screen
	- If keyboard have to be shown => smaller
	- own font managaing, however possible to get font pointer
	- GUI-interface-mode
		- arrows control GUI
		- some buttons are used to select an itm (like for touchscreen input)
	- every element shares some attributes
		- position (relative)
		- size (relative)
		- design
			- simple (just lines + spFont output)
			- bitmap (just the surface scaled or unscaled)
			- design
				- every corner and every edge an own surface
				- background surface
				- on the fly baking
	- elements
		- Area ( == window) can be in Area or at root
		- Button
			- Feedback function if clicked
			- Shortcut-button
		- Label
			- Text
		- Checkbox
			- Feedback function if state is changed
			- Shortcut-button
		- Radiobutton
			- Feedback function if state is changed to true
			- Shortcut-button
			- list of corresponding radio buttons, which are set to false
		- Textbox
			- Text (changeable)
			- Scrollbar
		- Bitmaplabel
			- Surface to show (maybe scaled)
	- draw_gui function
	- every gui is encapsulated in a bundle
	- gui file format
	- new testsparrow.c with gui

general Roadmap:
- drawing primitives as parallel process
	- gp2x:
		- zBuffer needs to be in upper mem!
		- division buffer in upper mem!
		- zfar in upper mem!
		- all math functions to upper mem!
		- init gp2x coprocessor
		- mutex for the state of the process
		- spBindTexture
			- setting getting physical address for gp2x for stack
- rotozoom on second processor
- all blits on second processor
	- with hardware blitter
- third device layer (controlled by sparrowCore)
  - axis are exactly the same
  - as much buttons createable as you want
  - button relation changeable
  - button name from host spGetButtonName
  - button is identifyable by name and id.
    - int spNewButton(char* name) => returns id (faster)
    - spGetButtonByName, spGetButtonByID
    - Returns *int => changeable
- sparrowText understands \n
