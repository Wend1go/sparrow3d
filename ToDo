Roadmap til next version (1.3.1):
- drawing lines as parallel process
	- usleep smaller
	- when state changes (zTest, zSet, etc.):
		- waiting for stack empty
		- stoping thread
		- doing state change
		- restarting new thread
	- spBindTexture
		- setting getting physical address for gp2x
	- using the stack as ring buffer to keep the order
	- init gp2x coprocessor
	- faster mutex on ARM without SDL_Delay!
	- mutex for the state of the process

Roadmap til 1.4:
- all 12 tutorials (4/12 done)
- Network (with threads)
- GUI

general Roadmap:
- third device layer (controlled by sparrowCore)
  - axis are exactly the same
  - as much buttons createable as you want
  - button relation changeable
  - button name from host spGetButtonName
  - button is identifyable by name and id.
    - int spNewButton(char* name) => returns id (faster)
    - spGetButtonByName, spGetButtonByID
    - Returns *int => changeable
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- sparrowText faster Lookup: O(log(n)) instead of O(n)

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
