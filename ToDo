README:
- wiki => incode documentation link
Roadmap:
- changes in the sparrow Font API (L'ß' or "ß" instead of the conversion call - not quite sure yet)
	- maybe ONE function for just one letter and range
- predefined ranges for sparrowFont (e.g. SP_ASCII or SP_GERMAN, SP_NUMBERS, SP_LETTERS, SP_SYMBOLS)
- marking, which signs we need in the language file
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- Network

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
